## Version 0.1 (Current)
### Added Features
- First implementation of the game. Needs major work in a number of areas
- All different textures are mapped to their own characters
- Movement is implemented for the head
### Known issues
- The movement is very janky and unreliable at the moment
- The body pieces don't follow the head, and can potentially become stuck
- Upon game over, the program ends, meaning if the user wants to play again, they must rerun the application
